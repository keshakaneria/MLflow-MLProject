############## Entry points ##############
- while giving a path it shouldnt have space or break in name -> give absolute while giving path
- give string as parameter and not as path
- all entry points should be run with _get_or_run functions which checked if entry point is added or not


############## Main.py ##############
- first arg should be main.py
- model path needs to be different everytime we run different independent entry point. If arguments are dependent, same model path is acceptable.


############## Metrics ##############
- same metric file can log multiple values
- different metric file can log same values
- Logs can be prepared from any file (*.py) and can be saved in metrics folder
- Individual log metrics can be stored individually according to name of log folder


############## Mlruns ##############
- whenever we run workflow, mlruns folder is created
- creates different folders to store for each entry point initially and single folder (for main entry point) for further runs
